# INST624 Final Project

This is the beginning of my project.


Project Steps - 

1. Find interesting API
2. Figure out how to access it
3. Experiment with accessing API
4. Retrieve information
5. Do some kind of data analysis


You would think something as trivial as sex would not be a statistically significant factor for crime, so I would like to test that theory with fugitive data from the fbi.
As the professor said many programs when executed contain a main file that runs a bunch of specialized functions. My goal is to create a module 
within which is a class that contain a bunch of speciality functions that will run on a main file with the data analysis and visualization and i will do that by using a chi square test.


I will be using the FBI Wanted API to answer my hypothesis -

Null
The proportion of male fugitives to female fugitives 
will be 50/50 as sex is not a relevent factor for crime.

Alt.
The proportion is not 50/50, the sexes will be disproportionate.
