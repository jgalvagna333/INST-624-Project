Pilots landing at the airports have experienced a laser illuminating and tracking the cockpit of their aircraft especially while on approach to land at SEA and GEG. Neighborhoods with reported incidents in Spokane include: the West Plains in Spokane, Nine Mile Falls, Green Bluff, and Hillyard.  Neighborhoods with reported incidents in Seattle include SeaTac, Vashon, White Center, Burien, West Kent, Lake Meridian Park, East Hill, and Des Moines.  The FBI believes multiple people are responsible for these incidents and does not believe the Seattle and Spokane incidents are related.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The FBI has worked with multiple local and federal agencies in an attempt to identify and locate the individual(s) responsible for these laser strikes and is seeking information from the public regarding these incidents.  Lasers pointed at an aircraft can interfere with landing and can increase the risk of injury to flight crew, passengers, and citizens within the local area.   Aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft is a federal offense and carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>
